<VersionBadge version="2.12.4" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using [**Descope**](https://www.descope.com), a complete authentication and user management solution. This integration uses the [**Remote OAuth**](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) pattern, where Descope handles user login and your FastMCP server validates the tokens.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:
1. To [sign up](https://www.descope.com/sign-up) for a Free Forever Descope account
2. Your **Project ID** from the [Descope Console](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
3. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

### Step 1: Configure Descope

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Dynamic Client Registration">
    1. Go to the [Inbound Apps page](https://app.descope.com/apps/inbound) of the Descope Console
    2. Click **DCR Settings**
    3. Enable **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**
    4. Define allowed scopes
    
    <Warning>
    DCR is required for FastMCP clients to automatically register with your authentication server.
    </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Note Your Project ID">
    Save your Project ID from [Project Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/project):
    ```
    Project ID: P2abc...123
    ```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your Descope configuration:

```bash
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=P2abc...123      # Your Descope Project ID
DESCOPE_BASE_URL=https://api.descope.com   # Descope API URL
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000     # Your server's base URL
```

<Note>
You can find your project's Descope Base URL in the [Multi-Region Support Guide](https://docs.descope.com/management/project-settings/multi-regional).
</Note>

### Step 3: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server file and use the DescopeProvider to handle all the OAuth integration automatically:

```python server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope import DescopeProvider

# The DescopeProvider automatically discovers Descope endpoints
# and configures JWT token validation
auth_provider = DescopeProvider(
    project_id=DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID,        # Your Descope Project ID
    base_url=SERVER_URL,                  # Your server's public URL
    descope_base_url=DESCOPE_BASE_URL,    # Descope API base URL
)

# Create FastMCP server with auth
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Descope Protected Server", auth=auth_provider)

```

## Testing

To test your server, you can use the `fastmcp` CLI to run it locally. Assuming you've saved the above code to `server.py` (after replacing the `project_id`, `base_url`, and `descope_base_url` with your actual values!), you can run the following command:

```bash
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Now, you can use a FastMCP client to test that you can reach your server after authenticating:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp/", auth="oauth") as client:
        assert await client.ping()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Environment Variables


For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

### Provider Selection

Setting this environment variable allows the Descope provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

<Card>
<ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" default="Not set">
Set to `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope.DescopeProvider` to use Descope authentication.
</ParamField>
</Card>

### Descope-Specific Configuration

These environment variables provide default values for the Descope provider, whether it's instantiated manually or configured via `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`.

<Card>
<ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_PROJECT_ID" required>
Your Descope Project ID from the [Descope Console](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_BASE_URL" required>
Public URL of your FastMCP server (e.g., `https://your-server.com` or `http://localhost:8000` for development)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_DESCOPE_BASE_URL" default="https://api.descope.com">
Descope API base URL for your [region/environment](https://docs.descope.com/management/project-settings/multi-regional)
</ParamField>
</Card>

Example `.env` file:
```bash
# Use the Descope provider
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope.DescopeProvider

# Descope configuration
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_PROJECT_ID=P2abc...123
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_DESCOPE_BASE_URL=https://api.descope.com
```

With environment variables set, your server code simplifies to:

```python server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Descope Protected Server")
```
