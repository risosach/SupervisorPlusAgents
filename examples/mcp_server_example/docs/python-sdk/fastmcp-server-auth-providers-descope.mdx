# `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope`


Descope authentication provider for FastMCP.

This module provides DescopeProvider - a complete authentication solution that integrates
with Descope's OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect services, supporting Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)
for seamless MCP client authentication.

Descope metadata provider for DCR (Dynamic Client Registration).

This provider implements Descope integration using metadata forwarding.
This is the recommended approach for Descope DCR
as it allows Descope to handle the OAuth flow directly while FastMCP acts
as a resource server.

IMPORTANT SETUP REQUIREMENTS:

1. Enable Dynamic Client Registration in Descope Console:
   - Go to the [Inbound Apps page](https://app.descope.com/apps/inbound) of the Descope Console
   - Click **DCR Settings**
   - Enable **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**
   - Define allowed scopes

2. Note your Project ID:
   - Save your Project ID from [Project Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
   - Example: P2abc...123

For detailed setup instructions, see:
https://docs.descope.com/identity-federation/inbound-apps/creating-inbound-apps#method-2-dynamic-client-registration-dcr


**Methods:**

#### `get_routes` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/providers/descope.py#L126" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_routes(self, mcp_path: str | None = None) -> list[Route]
```

Get OAuth routes including Descope authorization server metadata forwarding.

This returns the standard protected resource routes plus an authorization server
metadata endpoint that forwards Descope's OAuth metadata to clients.

**Args:**
- `mcp_path`: The path where the MCP endpoint is mounted (e.g., "/mcp")
This is used to advertise the resource URL in metadata.
