# `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.supabase`


Supabase authentication provider for FastMCP.

This module provides SupabaseProvider - a complete authentication solution that integrates
with Supabase Auth's JWT verification, supporting Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)
for seamless MCP client authentication.

Supabase metadata provider for DCR (Dynamic Client Registration).

This provider implements Supabase Auth integration using metadata forwarding.
This approach allows Supabase to handle the OAuth flow directly while FastMCP acts
as a resource server, verifying JWTs issued by Supabase Auth.

IMPORTANT SETUP REQUIREMENTS:

1. Supabase Project Setup:
   - Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
   - Note your project URL (e.g., "https://abc123.supabase.co")
   - For projects created after May 1st, 2025, asymmetric RS256 keys are used by default
   - For older projects, consider migrating to asymmetric keys for better security

2. JWT Verification:
   - FastMCP verifies JWTs using the JWKS endpoint at {project_url}/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json
   - JWTs are issued by {project_url}/auth/v1
   - Tokens are cached for up to 10 minutes by Supabase's edge servers

**Methods:**

#### `get_routes` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/providers/supabase.py#L128" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_routes(self, mcp_path: str | None = None) -> list[Route]
```

Get OAuth routes including Supabase authorization server metadata forwarding.

This returns the standard protected resource routes plus an authorization server
metadata endpoint that forwards Supabase's OAuth metadata to clients.

**Args:**
- `mcp_path`: The path where the MCP endpoint is mounted (e.g., "/mcp")
This is used to advertise the resource URL in metadata.
