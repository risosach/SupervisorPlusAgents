FastMCP 2.12 represents one of our most significant releases to date. After extensive testing and iteration with the community, we're shipping major improvements to authentication, configuration, and MCP feature adoption.

üîê **OAuth Proxy** bridges the gap for providers that don't support Dynamic Client Registration, enabling authentication with GitHub, Google, WorkOS, and Azure through minimal configuration.

üìã **Declarative JSON Configuration** introduces `fastmcp.json` as the single source of truth for server settings, making MCP servers as portable and shareable as container images.

üß† **Sampling API Fallback** tackles adoption challenges by letting servers generate completions server-side when clients don't support the feature, encouraging innovation while maintaining compatibility.

FastMCP 2.9 is a major release that, among other things, introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol. 

ü§ù *MCP Middleware* brings a flexible middleware system for intercepting and controlling server operations - think authentication, logging, rate limiting, and custom business logic without touching core protocol code. 

‚ú® *Server-side type conversion* for prompts solves a major developer pain point: while MCP requires string arguments, your functions can now work with native Python types like lists and dictionaries, with automatic conversion handling the complexity.

These features transform FastMCP from a simple protocol implementation into a powerful framework for building sophisticated MCP applications. Combined with the new `File` utility for binary data and improvements to authentication and serialization, this release makes FastMCP significantly more flexible and developer-friendly while maintaining full protocol compliance.

FastMCP 2.8 is here, and it's all about taking control of your tools.

This release is packed with new features for curating the perfect LLM experience:

üõ†Ô∏è Tool Transformation

The headline feature lets you wrap any tool‚Äîfrom your own code, a third-party library, or an OpenAPI spec‚Äîto create an enhanced, LLM-friendly version. You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code.

This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly [put it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamseaston_huge-thanks-to-william-easton-for-providing-activity-7338011349525983232-Mw6T?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAd6d0B3uL9zpCsq9eYWKi3HIvb8eN_r_Q), "Tool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head: stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools."

üè∑Ô∏è Component Control

Now that you're transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enable/disable any component, and for everyone who's been asking what FastMCP's tags are for‚Äîthey finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients.

üöÄ Pragmatic by Default

Lastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, we've made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, we'll restore the old default -- but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google!

<Update label="FastMCP 2.7" description="June 6, 2025" tags={["Releases"]}>

FastMCP 2.7 has been released!

Most notably, it introduces the highly requested (and Pythonic) "naked" decorator usage:

```python {3}
mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement.

The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated.

FastMCP 2.3 introduces full support for Streamable HTTP, a modern alternative to SSE that simplifies MCP deployments over the web. It‚Äôs efficient, reliable, and now the default HTTP transport. Just run your server with transport="http" and connect clients via a standard URL‚ÄîFastMCP handles the rest. No special setup required. This release makes deploying MCP servers easier and more portable than ever.

Even AI needs a good travel adapter üîå


FastMCP now supports proxying arbitrary MCP servers, letting you run a local FastMCP instance that transparently forwards requests to any remote or third-party server‚Äîregardless of transport. This enables transport bridging (e.g., stdio ‚áÑ SSE), simplified client configuration, and powerful gateway patterns. Proxies are fully composable with other FastMCP servers, letting you mount or import them just like local servers. Use `FastMCP.from_client()` to wrap any backend in a clean, Pythonic proxy.

This major release reimagines FastMCP as a full ecosystem platform, with powerful new features for composition, integration, and client interaction. You can now compose local and remote servers, proxy arbitrary MCP servers (with transport translation), and generate MCP servers from OpenAPI or FastAPI apps. A new client infrastructure supports advanced workflows like LLM sampling.
