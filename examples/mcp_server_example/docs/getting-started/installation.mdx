## Install FastMCP

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FastMCP.

If you plan to use FastMCP in your project, you can add it as a dependency with:

```bash
uv add fastmcp
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly with `pip` or `uv pip`:
<CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install fastmcp
    ```

    ```bash pip
    pip install fastmcp
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

To verify that FastMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
fastmcp version
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
$ fastmcp version

FastMCP version:                           2.11.3
MCP version:                               1.12.4
Python version:                            3.12.2
Platform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit
FastMCP root path:            ~/Developer/fastmcp
```
## Upgrading from the Official MCP SDK

Upgrading from the official MCP SDK's FastMCP 1.0 to FastMCP 2.0 is generally straightforward. The core server API is highly compatible, and in many cases, changing your import statement from `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` to `from fastmcp import FastMCP` will be sufficient. 


```python {5}
# Before
# from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# After
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")
```

<Warning>
Prior to `fastmcp==2.3.0` and `mcp==1.8.0`, the 2.x API always mirrored the official 1.0 API. However, as the projects diverge, this can not be guaranteed. You may see deprecation warnings if you attempt to use 1.0 APIs in FastMCP 2.x. Please refer to this documentation for details on new capabilities.
</Warning>

## Versioning Policy

FastMCP follows semantic versioning with pragmatic adaptations for the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem. Breaking changes may occur in minor versions (e.g., 2.3.x to 2.4.0) when necessary to stay current with the MCP Protocol.

For production use, always pin to exact versions:
```
fastmcp==2.11.0  # Good
fastmcp>=2.11.0  # Bad - will install breaking changes
```

See the full [versioning and release policy](/development/releases#versioning-policy) for details on our public API, deprecation practices, and breaking change philosophy.
