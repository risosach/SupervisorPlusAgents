<Update label="v2.12.0" description="2025-08-31">

**[v2.12.0: Auth to the Races](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.12.0)**

FastMCP 2.12 represents one of our most significant releases to date, both in scope and community involvement. After extensive testing and iteration with the community, we're shipping major improvements to authentication, configuration, and MCP feature adoption.

üîê **OAuth Proxy for Broader Provider Support** addresses a fundamental challenge: while MCP requires Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), many popular OAuth providers don't support it. The new OAuth proxy bridges this gap, enabling FastMCP servers to authenticate with providers like GitHub, Google, WorkOS, and Azure through minimal configuration. These native integrations ship today, with more providers planned based on community needs.

üìã **Declarative JSON Configuration** introduces a standardized, portable way to describe and deploy MCP servers. The `fastmcp.json` configuration file becomes the single source of truth for dependencies, transport settings, entrypoints, and server metadata. This foundation sets the stage for future capabilities like transformations and remote sources, moving toward a world where MCP servers are as portable and shareable as container images.

üß† **Sampling API Fallback** tackles the chicken-and-egg problem limiting adoption of advanced MCP features. Sampling‚Äîwhere servers request LLM completions from clients‚Äîis powerful but underutilized due to limited client support. FastMCP now lets server authors define fallback handlers that generate sampling completions server-side when clients don't support the feature, encouraging adoption while maintaining compatibility.

This release took longer than usual to ship, and for good reason: the community's aggressive testing and feedback on the authentication system helped us reach a level of stability we're confident in. There's certainly more work ahead, but these foundations position FastMCP to handle increasingly complex use cases while remaining approachable for developers.

Thank you to our new contributors and everyone who tested preview builds. Your feedback directly shaped these features.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.11.3" description="2025-08-11">

**[v2.11.3: API-tite for Change](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.11.3)**

This release includes significant enhancements to the experimental OpenAPI parser and fixes a significant bug that led schemas not to be included in input/output schemas if they were transitive dependencies (e.g. A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C implies A depends on C). For users naively transforming large OpenAPI specs into MCP servers, this may result in ballooning payload sizes and necessitate curation.

<Update label="v2.11.0" description="2025-08-01">

## [v2.11.0: Auth to a Good Start](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.11.0)

FastMCP 2.11 doubles down on what developers need most: speed and simplicity. This massive release delivers significant performance improvements and a dramatically better developer experience.

üîê **Enterprise-Ready Authentication** brings comprehensive OAuth 2.1 support with WorkOS's AuthKit integration. The new AuthProvider interface leverages MCP's support for separate resource and authorization servers, handling API keys and remote authentication with Dynamic Client Registration. AuthKit integration means you can plug into existing enterprise identity systems without rebuilding your auth stack, setting the stage for plug-and-play auth that doesn't require users to become security experts overnight.

‚ö° The **Experimental OpenAPI Parser** delivers dramatic performance improvements through single-pass schema processing and optimized memory usage. OpenAPI integrations are now significantly faster, with cleaner, more maintainable code. _(Note: the experimental parser is disabled by default, set `FASTMCPEXPERIMENTALENABLENEWOPENAPIPARSER=1` to enable it. A message will be shown to all users on the legacy parser encouraging them to try the new one before it becomes the default.)_

üß† **Context State Management** finally gives you persistent state across tool calls with a simple dict interface, while enhanced meta support lets you expose rich component metadata to clients. Combined with improved type annotations, string-based argument descriptions, and UV transport support, this release makes FastMCP feel more intuitive than ever.

This release represents a TON of community contributions and sets the foundation for even more ambitious features ahead.

## [v2.10.0: Great Spec-tations](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.10.0)

FastMCP 2.10 brings full compliance with the 6/18/2025 MCP spec update, introducing elicitation support for dynamic server-client communication and output schemas for structured tool responses. Please note that due to these changes, this release also includes a breaking change to the return signature of `client.call_tool()`.

### Elicitation Support
Elicitation allows MCP servers to request additional information from clients during tool execution, enabling more interactive and dynamic server behavior. This opens up new possibilities for tools that need user input or confirmation during execution.

### Output Schemas
Tools can now define structured output schemas, ensuring that responses conform to expected formats and making tool integration more predictable and type-safe.

## [v2.9.0: Stuck in the Middleware With You](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

FastMCP 2.9 introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol: MCP Middleware and server-side type conversion.

### MCP Middleware
MCP middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses at the protocol level, giving you powerful capabilities for logging, authentication, validation, and more. This is particularly useful for building production-ready MCP servers that need sophisticated request handling.

### Server-side Type Conversion
This release also introduces server-side type conversion for prompt arguments, ensuring that data is properly formatted before being passed to your functions. This reduces the burden on individual tools and prompts to handle type validation and conversion.

## [v2.8.0: Transform and Roll Out](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.8.0)

FastMCP 2.8.0 introduces powerful new ways to customize and control your MCP servers! 

### Tool Transformation

The highlight of this release is first-class [**Tool Transformation**](/patterns/tool-transformation), a new feature that lets you create enhanced variations of existing tools. You can now easily rename arguments, hide parameters, modify descriptions, and even wrap tools with custom validation or post-processing logic‚Äîall without rewriting the original code. This makes it easier than ever to adapt generic tools for specific LLM use cases or to simplify complex APIs. Huge thanks to [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) for partnering on this, starting with [#591](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/discussions/591) and [#599](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/599) and continuing offline.

### Component Control
This release also gives you more granular control over which components are exposed to clients. With new [**tag-based filtering**](/servers/server#tag-based-filtering), you can selectively enable or disable tools, resources, and prompts based on tags, perfect for managing different environments or user permissions. Complementing this, every component now supports being [programmatically enabled or disabled](/servers/tools#disabling-tools), offering dynamic control over your server's capabilities.

### Tools-by-Default
Finally, to improve compatibility with a wider range of LLM clients, this release changes the default behavior for OpenAPI integration: all API endpoints are now converted to `Tools` by default. This is a **breaking change** but pragmatically necessitated by the fact that the majority of MCP clients available today are, sadly, only compatible with MCP tools. Therefore, this change significantly simplifies the out-of-the-box experience and ensures your entire API is immediately accessible to any tool-using agent.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.7.0" description="2024-06-05">

## [v2.7.0: Pare Programming](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

This is primarily a housekeeping release to remove or deprecate cruft that's accumulated since v1. Primarily, this release refactors FastMCP's internals in preparation for features planned in the next few major releases. However please note that as a result, this release has some minor breaking changes (which is why it's 2.7, not 2.6.2, in accordance with repo guidelines) though not to the core user-facing APIs.

### Breaking Changes üõ´

* decorators return the objects they create, not the decorated function
* websockets is an optional dependency
* methods on the server for automatically converting functions into tools/resources/prompts have been deprecated in favor of using the decorators directly

### New Features üéâ

* allow passing flags to servers by [@zzstoatzz](https://github.com/zzstoatzz) in [#690](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/690)
* replace $ref pointing to `#/components/schemas/` with `#/$defs/` by [@phateffect](https://github.com/phateffect) in [#697](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/697)
* Split Tool into Tool and FunctionTool by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#700](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/700)
* Use strict basemodel for Prompt; relax from\_function deprecation by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#701](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/701)
* Formalize resource/functionresource replationship by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#702](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/702)
* Formalize template/functiontemplate split by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#703](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/703)
* Support flexible @tool decorator call patterns by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#706](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/706)
* Ensure deprecation warnings have stacklevel=2 by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#710](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/710)
* Allow naked prompt decorator by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#711](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/711)

### Fixes üêû

* Updates / Fixes for Tool Content Conversion by [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) in [#642](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/642)
* Fix pr labeler permissions by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#708](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/708)

* Fix links in README.md by [@alainivars](https://github.com/alainivars) in [#723](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/723)

Happily, this release DOES permit the use of "naked" decorators to align with Pythonic practice:

```python
@mcp.tool
def my_tool():
    ...
```
